# Personalized, digital medicine in the age of COVID and beyond

## Description: 
The COVID pandemic has disrupted the traditional medical model, and this year for the first time ever, more than 50% of Americans have done medicine digitally. Anthem's mission is to accelerate this innovation by building higher quality, more affordable, and more convenient medicine, and we need your help. In this hackathon, we ask that you invent a solution that could be part of this disruptive trend.

## Possible use cases: 
* Medicine for COVID
* Digital delivery of medicine
* More efficient medical system
* Portable, wearable and at-home medicine
* Other innovative ideas


## Examples of Projects
* An app to support people with a specific mental health diagnosis
* An AI-powered medical advisor for COVID-19

* An innovative app that simplifies buying medical insurance and medical bills
* Making a novel use of a wearable sensor
* Mining an unexplored healthcare dataset and making the data usable
