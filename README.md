**Main Challenge**
# Personalized, digital medicine in the age of COVID and beyond

## Description: 
Healthcare is a $4 trillion industry being disrupted by technology.
More than 50% of Americans have now used digital medicine, but the potential of digital solutions, AI and mobile health is just starting to impact.
In this hackathon, we ask that you invent a solution that could be part of this disruptive trend.

We are looking for innovative hacks that:
* Replace traditional medicine with higher-quality digital medicine
* Advance the person's Whole Health - livestyle, mind and body
* Help digital non-natives, elderly, immigrants or persons with special needs or conditions
* Middleware or platforms that support other solutions and help integrate

## Examples of Projects
* An app to support people with a specific mental health diagnosis
* An AI-powered medical advisor for COVID-19
* New functionality in a healthcare-related open source project (app, dataset) 
* An innovative app that simplifies buying medical insurance and medical bills
* Making a novel use of a wearable sensor
* Mining an unexplored healthcare dataset and making the data usable
* Developing an open source middleware solution that makes building solutions easier

We welcome both functional software solutions and an innovative mock-up of your solution. Our challenge is set to deepen the thinking of ‘What is next in digital medicine and health care delivery’. This industry is rapidly advancing and having a new generation of thinking can help shape how healthcare is delivered digitally.
